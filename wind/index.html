  <p>Heavy wind through trees. Modified from Farnell, Designing Sound Part IV: Practicals. 
    I compiled Farnell's pd patch example into web audio, then tweaked the parameters to my liking.
    I still don't like it though. I was going for a softer, less powerful wind but I'll leave that for another day.
    The way Farnell structures his model is with a wind speed patch that controls the strength of the wind,
    a wind noise patch where the actual sound of the wind comes from, and various other wind related patches
    such as whistling, leaves in the wind, and a flag waving in the wind. I set out to implement all of these,
    but ended up just doing the basic wind sound plus the whistling. The main difficulty I came across
    was implementing pd objects that don't have a corresponding Web Audio node, such as max~. To circumvent this
    issue I used the WaveShaperNode. I don't think it does the exact same thing as max~ (WaveShaper does some sort of
    linear interpolation perhaps), but it should have a similar effect. I implemented the main pd objects
    in Web Audio, such as +~, *~, lop~, hip~, and clip~. I also did a little panning, but not as complicated as Farnell.
    I just panned the whistle slightly right. As I said, it didn't turn out as soft as I'd like it, and I'd also like
    to implement the other wind related sounds Farnell did. Maybe later. Here's the graph:
